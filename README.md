# hidden-featured-image

Wordpress plugin to hide the featured image on posts and pages.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn how to create a Wordpress plugin and I had an issue with featured images that I wanted to solve. That was the perfect opportunity to learn.

Heavily inspired by [hide-featured-image](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/hide-featured-image/).

## Getting started

1. Create a directory in `wp-content/plugins` named `hidden-featured-image`.
2. Copy `hidden-featured-image.php` in the directory
3. Go to your wordpress website, and active the plugin
4. You can now hide featured image in posts and pages! ðŸš€
